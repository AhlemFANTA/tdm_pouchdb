# What is PouchDB
<p>
PouchDB is an open source in-browser database API written in JavaScript.   

It is modelled after Couch DB â€“ a NoSQL database. Using this API, we can build applications that work offline and online. 

It internally uses WebSQL and IndexedDB to store data.
</p>

#How Does it Work?
<p>
In PouchDB, when the application is offline, the data is stored locally using WebSQL and IndexedDB in the browser.   

When the application is back online, it is synchronized with CouchDB and compatible servers.  

Using PouchDB, you can communicate with both local and remote databases seamlessly without noticing any difference.
